            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>River Rush Adventures was founded over two decades ago by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who shared a love for the thrill of whitewater rafting. What started as a small, family-run business on the banks of a local river has grown into one of the most trusted and well-known rafting companies in the region.
                The founders, driven by a deep respect for nature and a desire to share the beauty of the river with others, set out with just a few rafts and a bold vision: to make whitewater rafting accessible and exciting for adventurers of all skill levels. Over the years, their commitment to safety, personalized service, and unforgettable experiences helped River Rush Adventures expand its operations, offering a wide variety of rafting trips from gentle family-friendly floats to heart-pounding rapids that challenge even the most seasoned rafters.
